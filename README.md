# Zoom Mute Button

A DIY Zoom "mute" button for your Puck.js BLE beacon (Espruino),

For those a little too far away from their computers to press the keyboard shortcut themselves.

This will toggle your mute button on and off on Zoom by sending 2 key presses of GUI+Shift+A:

- When you press the button down ("rising")
- When you release the button ("falling")
